# SLALIB (Starlink Positional Astronomy Library) for the GEM7 / EPICS 3.13.4
# generation, cross-compiled for vxWorks ppc604.
#
# WHY THE VERSION IS IN THE PACKAGE NAME. VxWorks has no shared libraries: an
# IOC does `ld < .../timelib/V1-8-6/bin/ppc604/timelib` at boot, so the copy on
# the file server IS the code that runs, and two IOCs may need two versions
# resident at once. RPM permits only one version per package NAME, so a plain
# "gem7-timelib" could not satisfy that -- dnf would delete V1-9-4 to install
# V1-9-7 and the next boot of anything pinned to V1-9-4 would fail. Putting the
# version in the name makes them distinct, co-installable packages.
#
# (The alternative, Provides: installonlypkg(kernel), does work with no host
# config -- measured -- but installonly_limit=3 then silently deletes the
# oldest version when a fourth arrives, which on this tree means a running
# instrument losing the library it boots. Rejected for that reason.)

# The version appears twice, in %%define name and %%define version, and the
# %%if guard below turns a mismatch into a build error. It cannot be reduced to
# one place with today's pipeline: gemini-rtsw-ci/build_rpm.sh reads BOTH the
# name and the version by grepping the spec as TEXT, so a macro in either
# arrives unexpanded -- Name becomes the GHCR image tag verbatim, and Version
# silently falls back to "1.0", which then names a source tarball the spec
# cannot find ("Bad source: ...-1.0.tar.gz"). Its rpmspec fallback for Version
# exists but only fires under profile=lightweight, and this is an epics build.
#
# %%define name / %%define version is the shape build_rpm.sh greps for first, so
# it is the form that works unmodified. hrwfs carries
# docs/gemini-rtsw-ci-macro-name.patch to lift both greps to rpmspec; once
# that merges these collapse to a single %%global.

%description
timelib %{version}, the version the GEM7 IOCs load at boot, installed at
%{instdir}. Built from the CVS history converted with full provenance: this
tree is CVS tag %{libdir}, byte-identical to a `cvs export` of the same tag.

The version is part of the package name so that several versions can be
installed at once -- see the comment at the top of the spec.

%changelog
* Mon Sep 14 2026 Hawi Stecher <hawi.stecher@noirlab.edu> - 1.8.6-1
- First packaged build. Source is CVS tag V1-8-6 from
  polaris:/usr/software/dev/cvsroot/rtcvsroot, converted with cvs2git and
  verified byte-identical to a cvs export of that tag. Built with ANL's
  Linux gcc 2.96 against Tornado 2.0.2 headers; the object is equivalent to
  the deployed one, differing only in that 2.96 applies -mlongcall
  consistently where gcc 2.7.2 emitted some direct bl (REL-4693 precedent).
